# Calculator Built with React/Vite

This calculator app was built as a learning project without tutorials or AI-generated code. The goal was to create a functional calculator using React and TailWind CSS, while also incorporating mathematical expression parsing with math.js and rendering with KaTeX. To view the live application, visit my [Vercel deployment](https://calc-eight-theta.vercel.app/).

## Technologies Used

- React
- Vite
- TailWind CSS
- KaTeX
- math.js
- Vercel for deployment

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Handling of decimal values
- State management with React hooks
- Modern UI design with TailWind CSS
- Basic error handling for invalid inputs
- Conversion between display formats (using KaTeX) and calculation formats (for evaluation by math.js) using regular expressions
